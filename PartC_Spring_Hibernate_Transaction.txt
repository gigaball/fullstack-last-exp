Java Applications Using Spring and Hibernate

Part C: Transaction Management Using Spring and Hibernate

Objective:
To create a banking system using Spring and Hibernate that handles money transfers with transaction consistency.

Explanation:
- Create Account and Transaction entities.
- Annotate service layer methods with @Transactional.
- Implement transfer logic: deduct from one account, add to another.
- Rollback transaction automatically if any operation fails.

This demonstrates declarative transaction management and integration of Spring services with Hibernate persistence.
