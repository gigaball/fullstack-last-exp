Java Applications Using Spring and Hibernate

Part A: Dependency Injection in Spring Using Java-Based Configuration

Objective:
To create a simple Spring application that demonstrates Dependency Injection (DI) using Java-based configuration instead of XML.

Explanation:
- Create two classes: Student and Course.
- Student depends on Course.
- Use annotations: @Configuration, @Bean.
- Use AnnotationConfigApplicationContext to load context and retrieve Student bean.

This demonstrates how Spring manages object creation and wiring through DI without XML configuration.
